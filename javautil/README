JavaUtil 2.0.6 -- A Utility Library for Developing Java Software
Center for Comprehensive Informatics, Emory University

OVERVIEW

Welcome to JavaUtil. We developed this over multiple years during our
internal development efforts, and it has reached a point of stability
where we have decided to make it available to the outside world. The
JavaUtil package aims to fill in the gaps of the Apache Commons and
similar utility libraries out there.  Features include convenience
classes for string, collections, arrays, dates, iterators, colors,
logging, unit testing, a little bit of basic statistics, database
queries, caching and more.

WHAT'S NEW

Version 2.0.6 is a bug fix release. There are no new features. We moved the
package to our new public Maven repository (see below).

REQUIREMENTS

The current version is known to work with Oracle Java 6. It is
expected to work with OpenJDK 6 as well. It is incompatible with Java
7.
